    <p><h4 id="p1">To start off this amazing recipe, here are a list of ingredients.</h4></p>
    <h2 id="p1">Ingredients</h2>
    <br>
    <ul id="text1">
        <li><em>Butter:</em> This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li><em>Eggs:</em> Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><em>Vanilla:</em> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
        <li><em>Baking soda:</em> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><em>Water:</em> A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
        <li><em>Salt:</em> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li><em>Flour:</em> All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
        <li><em>Chocolate chips:</em> Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
        <li><em>Nuts (optional):</em> Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <br>
    <ol id="text1">

        <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
        <li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake until the edges are golden brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="p1">How Long to Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>

    <p id="p1">In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, the chocolate chip cookies should be perfectly baked in about 10 minutes. The edges should be golden brown and the cookies should be mostly set (they'll continue to set as the cool).</p>

    <h1 id="p1">Test Kitchen Tips</h1>

    <p id="p1">“Everyone needs a good chocolate chip cookie recipe,” says culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). Here are a few of her expert tips and tricks for making perfect chocolate chip cookies every time: </p>

    <ul id="text1">
        <li>Beating the butter and sugar is the most important part of the chocolate chip cookie-making process, according to Nicole. It takes a lot longer than you might think: She recommends beating the ingredients together for about four minutes.</li>
        <li>Nicole suggests chilling the dough before baking to prevent spreading. This is essential if you want a cookie that’s still a little gooey in the middle, she says. </li>
        <li>Make sure to let the cookies rest on the baking sheet for a few minutes after you take them out of the oven. This step prevents tearing and keeps each cookie in one piece.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h1 id="p1">How Long Do Chocolate Chip Cookies Last?</h1>

    <p id="p1">Store the cooled chocolate chip cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. If you want to go the extra mile, throw a piece of white bread into the container — it'll absorb the dry air and keep the cookies soft for longer.</p>
