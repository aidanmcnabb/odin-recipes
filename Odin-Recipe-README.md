Hello! This project will be based on the skills I have learned so far which
include: 

Creating a github repository locally and remotely

Type out my HTML Boilerplate

Create absolute and relative links

Practice use of lists, images and different text options.

Practice good commits along with their messages

I will be making a website for recipes! I have this README file here so I
may be able to look back at this and view my progress over time!# odin-recipes
